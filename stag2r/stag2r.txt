Released 08th August 2018

Stag2r was released due to some servers not supporting BSP2 etc.  It was slightly too long.

Stag2 by lordy

Released 31st July 2018, about 15 years since I first released stag.  This was decompiled from .bsp so the brushes are messy.  I had to delete 500 (about half) of the brushes.  Feel free to clean up or reuse.

Stag2 was changed to make it smaller/easier for travel between bases to try to get the game tempo up.  A flag cap bug was also fixed.
