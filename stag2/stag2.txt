Stag2 by lordy

Released 31st July 2018, about 15 years since I first released stag.  This was decompiled from .bsp so the brushes are messy.  I had to delete 500 (about half) of the brushes.  Feel free to clean up or reuse.

Stag2 was changed to make it smaller/easier for travel between bases to try to get the game tempo up.
